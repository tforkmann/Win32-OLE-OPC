Revision history for Perl extension Win32::OLE::OPC.

1.0.1 Mon Jul  5 16:42:47 2004
        - Set the version number this time, 1.0 said it was 0.93 which was a
          lie.
1.0  Wed Jun  9 12:21:57  2004
        - NOTE: AddItems and Remove now take server handle and error array
          references as arguments.
        - Remove the EU properties from the default item property fetch
          because they are not in the mandatory set of properties.
        - Pass on the 'flatten the namespace' argument to ShowLeafs only if it
          is true.
     Changes made by Karl Scherer <scherer@hotmail.com, scherer@gene.com>:
        - Removed lots of =pod lines which weren't needed.
        - Added SyncRead method which reads a large number of items
          efficiently.
        - Switch to a proper implementation of AddItems.  I couldn't get this
          to work because of bugs in the then current version of ActivePerl
          Variant support, it all looks good now though.
